Microservices

Martin Fowler
1st law of distributed systems is not to make a distributed system.
It makes it more difficult to order.

If you want to split single monolithic systems into multiple systems you really have to have a good reason.
If the system really is too big. The only solution is separate the concerns. Sometimes there are no other solutions.
It is impossible to change.
If you want to have autonomous development around subsystems.
Deploy independently.
Boost morale and deploy faster. You can get value from this speed. Allowing for the creation of automous.
