# The Adapter and Facade Pattern #

This is the seventh blog post in a series on Design Patterns, in which we're looking at some of the most helpful design patterns for your software design.

The last post covered, the **Command Pattern** which encapsulates a command request as an object.

This blog looks at the Adapter and Facade Pattern, whcih converts the interface of a class into another interface, thereby matching interfaces of different classes.
