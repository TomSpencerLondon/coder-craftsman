This is the second in a series of five blogs on the SOLID Design Principles. Read about the first principle, the Single responsibility principle here [title](https://www.example.com), and the second - the Open-closed principle here. 

The **Liskov substitution principle** states that objects in a programme should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that programme.

One of the harder principles to make sense of, it was first introduced by Barbara Liskov at a 1987 conference keynote address titled Data abstraction and hierarchy. The Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called (strong) behavioral subtyping.

**It can be stated as such:**

If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a programme may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that programme.

**You can express it mathematically as:**

*Let Ï•(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T.
Then Ï•(y) should be true for objects y of type S, where S is a subtype of T.*

**Or to make it simpler, here it is in "duck terms":**

If it looks like a ðŸ¦†, quacks like a ðŸ¦† but needs batteries - you probably have the wrong level of abstraction.

This dictates that, for your code to adhere to LSP, all subclasses* must be completely interchangeable with their parent class.

Let's look at an illustration of LSP substitution using a Rectangle Factory:

```
package LSP;

public class Lsp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rectangle = RectangleFactory.newRectangle(2, 4);
        Rectangle square = RectangleFactory.newSquare(4);

        showArea(rectangle);
        showArea(square);
    }

    private static void showArea(Rectangle figure) {
        System.out.println("Expected area is " + figure.getArea() + " for " + figure.toString());
    }
}
```
Here the RectangleFactory returns a square or rectangle depending on what we require in the client:
```
package LSP;

public class RectangleFactory {
    public static Rectangle newSquare(int side) {
        return new Rectangle(side, side);
    }

    public static Rectangle newRectangle(int width, int height) {
        return new Rectangle(width, height);
    }
}
```
This is the Rectangle itself:
```
package LSP;

public class Rectangle {
    private int width, height;

    Rectangle(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    int getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Figure(" +
                "width=" + width +
                ", height=" + height +
                ')';
    }
}
```
We can then create a Rectangle or a Square depending on what we send to the Factory and each instance is interchangeable:
```
package LSP;

public class Lsp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rectangle = RectangleFactory.newRectangle(2, 4);
        Rectangle square = RectangleFactory.newSquare(4);

        showArea(rectangle);
        showArea(square);
    }

    private static void showArea(Rectangle figure) {
        System.out.println("Expected area is " + figure.getArea() + " for " + figure.toString());
    }
}
```
So we can see that through our showArea method this becomes clear.

As we have seen LSP enables us to replace objects in a programme with instances of their subtype without altering the correctness of that programme.

Next we will look at the Interface segregation principle.
